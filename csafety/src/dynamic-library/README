Unlinke static libraries, dynamic libraries can not be made using the `ar'
utility and instead must be constructed by supplying directions to the compiler
telling it to create them. Because our dyanmic library is not going to be
installed we also have to specify the "-rpath" so that the dynamic loader knows
how to find the executable. Normally with a library we will be installing to
the end target of a system's /lib directory "-rpath" should not be specified.
Another way to do this is to not use "rpath" at all and instead execute the
test binary in place like this `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd) ./main'. Presented below
are 5 files that can be put into a directory to create a simple dynamic library
build system.
