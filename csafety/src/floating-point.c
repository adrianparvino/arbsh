	"Floating-point arithmetic is a systematic approximation of real 
	arithmetic, [...] Floating-point arithmetic can only represent a 
	finite subset of the continuum of real numbers.Consequently, certain 
	properties of real arithmetic, such as associativity of addition, do 
	not always hold for floating-point arithmetic" (IEEE-754-2008 3.2)
