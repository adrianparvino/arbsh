All internal computations must be done in base 10:

"Internal computations shall be conducted as if in decimal, regardless of the 
input and output bases, to the specified number of decimal digits"

This creates serious problem, and disallows the passing of "base" to the
arithmetic functions when obase=ibase and obase comes before ibase.

Due to inherent incompatabilities it is not always possible to directly
translate one base to another.



"Exact calculation of the number of fractional digits to output for a given 
value in a base other than 10 can be computationally expensive. Historical 
implementations use a faster approximation, and this is permitted."
