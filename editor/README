About:
------

	Grafland's editor is a dead simple notepad-like text editor. It was
	designed primarily to test grafland's minimal curses implementation.

	The grafland editor can be easily modified to not depend on the curses
	library, however this has the tendency to hard code terminal 
	capabalities. If you are interested in forking this project and making
	a version which does not depend on curses, please contact me.
