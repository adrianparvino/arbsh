About:
------

	Grafland's editor is a dead simple notepad-like text editors. It was
	desgined primarily to test grafland's minimal curses implementation.

	The grafland editor can be easily modified to not depend on the curses
	library, however this has the tendency to hard code terminal capabali-
	ties. If you are interested in forking this project and making a version
	which does not depend on curses, please contact me.
