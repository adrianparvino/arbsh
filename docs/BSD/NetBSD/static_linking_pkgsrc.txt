05:30 < dh`> there are more aggressive things you can do to try to force it
05:30 < dh`> but most likely they'll just break builds.
05:43 < dcmg> I am fine with that, If you have any suggestions.
05:44 < dcmg> ( not really a normal user here, I try to maintain as many static 
              binaries for the various OS and architectures as possible)
05:44 < dcmg> If things break, it is not a big deal for me
05:46 < dcmg> I am the only person who uses the binaries to my knowledge ( 
              maybe a few linux users user my ``mplayer'' but that is it
06:18 < dh`> well
06:19 < dh`> in a pkgsrc-only section of mk.conf you can put LDFLAGS+=-static
06:19 < dh`> a lot of packages honor pkgsrc LDFLAGS because that's how rpaths 
             get set
06:20 < dh`> however, this will probably just flatly break the build of 
             packages that build libraries
06:20 < dh`> you can also try _WRAP_EXTRA_ARGS.CC+=-static
06:21 < dh`> or possibly _WRAP_EXTRA_ARGS.LDCC, not sure
06:21 < dh`> (or CCLD maybe)
06:22 < dh`> but it would probably be more productive to build in a chroot that 
             just doesn't have shared libs
06:53 < ASau> The use of static linking breaks all packages that use FFI.
