Make statically linked executables for NetBSD
---------------------------------------------

   echo "LDSTATIC=-static" >> /etc/mk.conf

This is actually all that is required.

To test ``cd'' into a direcotory of source code, make the binary
, and then test it with ldd, and a final time by running it.

   cd /usr/src/csh
   make

   ldd csh

This should output the text:

   ldd: csh: not dynamically linked
