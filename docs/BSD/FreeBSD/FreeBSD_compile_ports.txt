FreeBSD ports
-------------

Compile and install a simple program using the FreeBSD ports.

Get and unarchive the tarball "ports.txz",  and then specify
the working directory with `make -C' or simply by changing to
the source code directory for the program.

As an example, compile the shell "dash". All of these commands 
were run as root.

  fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/`uname -m`/`uname -m`/`uname -r`/ports.txz
  tar -xf ports.txz -C / 
  make -C /usr/ports/shells/dash/ 
  make install -C /usr/ports/shells/dash/ 
 

If there were no compile errors your program should now be
installed, and can be invoked by typing:

  dash
