FreeBSD ports
-------------

Compile and install a simple program using the FreeBSD ports.

Get and unarchive the tarball "ports.txz", change directory
to the program you wish to compile, and invoke `make' to compile 
the program, then `make install' to install it.

As an example, compile the shell "dash" on FreeBSD 9.2:

  ftp ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/i386/i386/9.1-STABLE/ports.txz 
  tar -xf ports.txz -C / 
  cd /usr/ports/shells/dash/ 
  make 
  make install

If there were no compile errors your program should now be
installed.
