FreeBSD build the /rescue system
--------------------------------

The FreeBSD rescue system uses a statically compiled crunchgen
made binary. This binary can also be used to create a minimal
FreeBSD installation or customized rescue environment.

   make -C /usr/src/rescue 

The resulting binary: 

   /usr/src/rescue/rescue/rescue


The newly built rescue system can then be installed, or you 
can simply use the stand alone binary above.

   make install
