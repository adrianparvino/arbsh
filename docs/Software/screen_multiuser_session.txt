`screen' multiuser sessions
---------------------------

Put the entries "multiuser on" and "acladd root" into the file 
"~/.screenrc", start a screen session ( "screen -s my_screen_session" )
and then attach it from the other user, in ths case we are using "john"
and "root" as our users.

   john@host: $  echo "multiuser on" >> ~/.screenrc
   john@host: $  echo "acladd root"  >> ~/.screenrc
   john@host: $  screen -s my_screen_session

   root@host: #  screen -x john/my_screen_session
