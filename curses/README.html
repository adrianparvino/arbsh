	Graff's curses or gcurses is a minimal implementation of the curses
	standard library. gcurses implements a subset of the X / curses
	standard.

	Gcurses is completely original code written by CM Graff from scratch.
	It borrows from the model that K&R2 uses for its minimal stdio
	implementation. The WINDOW objects are not opaque but should be treated
	and used as opaque objects so as to ensure that the resulting code is
	portable.

	gcurses needs access to grafland's terminal escape sequence definitions
	from grafland/termcap. After you have installed these headers into the
	parent directory of grafland or your development system then gcurses can
	be compiled.

		cd grafland/termcap
		make
		make install

		cd grefland/curses
		make
		make install

	Gcurses should now be installed to grafland/lib and its header files
	installed to grafland/include and you can proceed to use test the 
	library grafland/lib/libgcurses.a. The simplest way to test gcusers is
	by compiling it into the test editor that is supplied at
	grafland/editor. Compile the editor with the "native" argument so that
	it knows to use gcurses instead of the system curses.


		cd grafland/editor
		make native

	If all ran successfully the text editor should be linked to gcurses as
	its primary screen drawing library. It can be tested as follows:

		./editor Makefile

	Use ctrl-n to quit the test editor, ctrl-x saves the changes.
