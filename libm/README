Description:
------------

	Graff's libm is derived from Sun's fdlibm (Freely Distributable libm). 
	Unlike many vendors the goal of this distribution is not to add 
	architectures or functionalities. Indeed, all architecture specific 
	support has been removed from this version of libm such that it can be 
	compiled and used for most any architecture that supports floating 
	point. The primary focus of this project is to remove enough cruft from
	fdlibm that the underlying algorithms ( which are implemented in plain
	C) can be more easily understood.
