20:44 < Hafydd> graff: if the base b = Prod_{i=1}^n p_i^r_i, where {p_i} are distinct prime numbers and each r_i > 0, and the 
                denominator d = Prod_{i=1}^n p_i^s_i, then the fractional part in base b has k = max_{i=1}^n ceil(s_i/r_i) digits 
                (after the radix point). This is the smallest k such that d divides b^k = Prod_{i=1}^n p_i^(k r_i), i.e. forall i. k 
                r_i - s_i >= 0, i.e. k >= s_i/_ri.
20:45 < graff> Hafydd: i can't reaqd that stuff. but I will copy paste it for the day that aliens come down and enlarge my brain
20:45 < graff> thank you
20:45 < Hafydd> graff: what part of it do you not understand?
20:46 < graff> Hafydd: pretty much everything. I am not sure if that was latex or what, or some other type of notation

20:46 < graff> base b = Prod_{i=1}^n p_i^r_i,
20:46 < graff> like what is that in very simple terms?
20:46 < Hafydd> graff: it is LaTeX-inspired mathematical notation commonly used on IRC. If you don't know LaTeX, you may have 
                difficulty understanding it.
20:47 < graff> Hafydd: pretty much
20:47 < Hafydd> graff: that is the product from i=1 to n of p_i raised to the power of r_i.
20:47 < Hafydd> graff: where p_i is p with subscript i, and r_i is r with subscript i.

20:47 < graff> ah ok, so that is subscript. nice
20:47 < graff> well, I am learning something i guess. thanks Hafydd 
20:48 < graff> so these Prod things are sort of like cartesian products?
20:48 < somiaj> no, just normal products of numbers
20:48 < somiaj> similar to a finite sigma sum, Sigma_{n=a}^b a_n is just a sum.


If the base $b$ equals
$$
\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{r_i}
$$
where $\{p_i\}$ are distinct prime numbers and each $r_i > 0$, and the denominator $d$ equals
$$
\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{s_i}
$$
then the fractional part in base $b$ has
$$
k = \mathrm{max}_{i=1}^n \mathrm{ceil}(s_i/r_i)
$$
digits (after the radix point).

This is the smallest $k$ such that $d$ divides
$$
b^k = \prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{k r_i}
$$
i.e. for all $i$, $k r_i - s_i \ge 0$

i.e. for all $i$, $k \ge s_i/r_i$.
