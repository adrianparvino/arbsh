Q: 
is there a smart way to optimize i = i % 0x7fffffff; into bit ops, where i is usigned int ?

A:
not sure about bit ops but you can trivially do it with conditional subtraction
i==0xffffffff ? 1 : i>0x7fffffff ? i-0x7fffffff : i
if we leave out the 0xffffffff case for now, that's
i -= -(i>>31) & 0x7fffffff;
and you could just repeat that twice i think
