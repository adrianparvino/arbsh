arbsh

DESCRIPTION:
------------

	arbsh is a collection of original software written by CM Graff et al.


	Navigating to a subdirectory of arbsh and inspecting the README 
	will reveal more about what that particular project contains.


	

HIER:
-----

	arbprec/
		An arbitrary precision mathematics library.

	readline/
		Readline line editing library. An editline/readline like 
		implementation.  

	gsh/
		Gsh supports a subset of POSIX shell.  

	posix/
		Userland utilities such as cp, ls, fetch, dd, find etc.
		implemented to subsets of their POSIX specifications.

	ironwill/
		A cross compiling toolchain and package build system similiar
		to buildroot or yocto but much simpler.  

	newlibm/
		A set of mathematics functions to operate on double precision
		types. This area contains code derived from Sun's fdlibm. And
		is the only part of of arbsh which is not 100 percent original.

	arbsh will also retrieve and build a collection of heavily modified
	outside software which is also maintained by CM Graff et al.
	
	graflibc
		graflibc is a new libc that draws on parts of musl libc.
		https://github.com/cmgraff/graflibc 

	cube-zero
		A verion of the cube 1 3D video game which is being slowly
		rewritten in C. https://github.com/cmgraff/cube-zero 

	ash 
		A new version of the Almquist shell forked from debian dash.
		https://github.com/cmgraff/ash


BUILDING:
---------

	make
	make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/myroot

	Install a single component of arbsh: 
	  
       		cd arbsh/posix
		make
		make install DESTDIR=/path/to/target


CROSSBUILDING:
--------------- 

	Use arbsh's internal gcc based cross compile system to build itself
	or outside software. Links and build specifics are supplied for 50 
	target packages.  


		make ironwill

		export `make buildenvars`

		make

		make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/myroot


	For finer grained control over the cross toolchain (such as changing 
	architectures or using the toolchain to build other OS)), view the 
	documentation within toolchain/README and run the build system from 
	toolchain/.


PORTABILITY:
------------

	To some extent all of the components of arbsh are standalone. The 
	core functionality (excluding the toolchain) only depends on the 
	standard C library and a few POSIX extensions to it. This being the 
	case it should work fine on Linux, mac, NetBSD and FreeBSD.
