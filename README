Grafland

DESCRIPTION:
------------

	Grafland is a collection of original software written by CM Graff et al.


	Navigating to a subdirectory of grafland and inspecting the README 
	will reveal more about what that particular project contains.
	

HIER:
-----

	arbprec/
		An arbitrary precision mathematics library.

	readline/
		Readline line editing library. An editline/readline like 
		implementation.  

	curses/
		A minimal curses library implementation. 

	termcap/
		Terminal capability definitions for hexen / curses.

	editor/
		A basic notepad-like editor implementation which runs in a 
		terminal.

	gsh/
		Gsh supports a subset of POSIX shell.

	irc/
		An extremely small client with minimal resource usage.
	
	posix/
		Userland utilities such as cp, ls, fetch, dd, find etc.
		implemented to subsets of their POSIX specifications.

	toolchain/
		A cross compiling toolchain and package build system similiar
		to buildroot or yocto but much simpler. 

	csafety/
		C-safety is an educational pamphlet on C programming, 
		C safety and data structures.


	Grafland will also retrieve and build a collection of heavily modified
	outside software which is also maintained by CM Graff et al.
	
	libc

		graflibc is a new libc that draws on parts of musl libc.
		https://github.com/cmgraff/graflibc


	grafcube

		A verion of the cube 1 3D video game which is being slowly
		rewritten in C. https://github.com/cmgraff/grafcube


	ash

		A new version of the Almquist shell forked from debian dash.
		https://github.com/cmgraff/ash


BUILDING:
---------

	make
	make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/myroot

	Install a single component of grafland: 
	  
       		cd grafland/posix
		make
		make install DESTDIR=/path/to/target


CROSSBUILDING:
--------------- 

	Use grafland's internal gcc based cross compile system to build itself
	or outside software. Links and build specifics are supplied for 50 
	target packages.  


		make toolchain

		export `make buildenvars`

		make

		make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/myroot


	For finer grained control over the cross toolchain (such as changing 
	architectures or using the toolchain to build other OS)), view the 
	documentation within toolchain/README and run the build system from 
	toolchain/.


PORTABILITY:
------------

	To some extent all of the components of grafland are standalone. The 
	core functionality (excluding the toolchain) only depends on the 
	standard C library and a few POSIX extensions to it. This being the 
	case it should work fine on Linux, mac, NetBSD and FreeBSD.
