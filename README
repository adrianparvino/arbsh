Grafland 

DESCRIPTION:
------------

	Grafland is a collection of original software written by myself
	(Graff) and various contributors.


	Navigating to a subdirectory of grafland and inspecting the README 
	will reveal more about what that particular project contains.
	

HIER:
-----


	libc/
		Standard C library components.
	
	libc/src/math/
		Libm mathematics functions which operate on and tranform 
		double precision types. This library covers most of the math.h / 
		libm normative cases.

	arbprec/
		Arbitrary precision mathematics.

	readline/
		Readline line editing. An editline/readline like implementation.
		This library is used to supply line editing and history to the 
		graff shell (Gsh) and grafland irc client.
		
		A unique "ircline" function is provided for programmers wishing
		to implement single line editing.

	curses/
		A minimal curses implementation. This implementation and its
		associated terminal capability definitions are used to power
		grafland's shell, irc client, editor and readline library. 

	termcap/
		Terminal capability definitions for hexen / curses.

	editor/
		A basic notepad-like editor implementation which runs in a 
		terminal.

	gsh/
		Gsh supports a subset of POSIX shell.

	irc/
		An extremely small client with minimal resource usage.
	
	posix/
		Userland utilities such as cp, ls, fetch, dd, find etc.
		implemented to subsets of their POSIX specifications.

	toolchain/
		A cross compiling toolchain and package build system. Grafland's
		toolchain is similiar to `buildroot' but with much simpler code
		This benefits programmers wishing to understand such things as
		toolchain development, building packages, and bootstrapping for
		new target architectures.


BUILDING:
---------

	make
	make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/myroot

	Install a single component of grafland: 
	  
       		cd grafland/posix
		make
		make install DESTDIR=/path/to/target


CROSSBUILDING:
--------------- 

	Use grafland's internal gcc based cross compile system to build itself
	or outside software. Links and build specifics are supplied for 50 
	target packages.  


		make toolchain

		export `make buildenvars`

		make

		make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/myroot


	For finer grained control over the cross toolchain (such as changing 
	architectures or using the toolchain to build other OS)), view the 
	documentation within toolchain/README and run the build system from 
	toolchain/.


PORTABILITY:
------------

	To some extent all of the components of grafland are standalone. The 
	core functionality (excluding the toolchain) only depends on the 
	standard C library and a few POSIX extensions to it. This being the 
	case it should work fine on Linux, mac, NetBSD and FreeBSD.
