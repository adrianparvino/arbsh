Description
-----------

	To some extent all of the components of grafland are standalone. 
	The core functionality (excluding the toolchain) depends on only 
	the standard C library and a few POSIX extensions to it. This 
	being the case it should work fine on linux, mac, NetBSD and 
	FreeBSD.


BUILDING:
---------

	make

INSTALLATION:
-------------

	make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/myroot


PARTIAL INSTALLATION:
--------------------
        Install a single component of grafos: 
          
       		cd grafos/cbin
        	make
        	make install DESTDIR=/path/to/target


CROSS BUILDING:
--------------- 
	The cross toolchain build system located inside of
	toolchain/ can be used to create a cross toolchain
	and then cross build the rest of the OS:

		make toolchain

		export `make buildenvars`

		make

		make install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/myroot


	For finer grained control over the cross toolchain
	(such as changing architectures) you'll want to change
	directories to toolchain/ and view the documentation
	within toolchain/README.


DOCUMENTATION:
--------------
	Each subdirectory has a README which documents its usage.

RELENG:
-------

	make release

UPSTREAM:
---------
	git clone https://github.com/cmgraff/Grafos


HIER:
----
	cbin/
		Userland applications written in C (native)
	clib/
		Standard C library components and helper libraries, (native)
		
		Gshline. An editline/readline like implementation. This
		library is used to supply line editing and history to
		the graff shell (Gsh) and Grafos irc client. The latter
		is supplied with a unique ircline() funtion (native).

	cmath/
		Trancendental mathematics functions written in C (native).
	docs/
		Whitepages I have written to document various OS and books (native).
	editor/
		A native editor.
	wm/
		A rewrite of dwm.
	Gsh/
		A native shell.
	irc/
		A native irc client and library.
	README
		This README.
	shbin/
		Userland applications and libraries written in POSIX shell (native).
	toolchain/
		The omnicross toolchain (native)
			-Link grafos components up into the toolchain
			 for compilation and installation.
			-Build and maintain outside software.

	ottercross/
		The ottercross PoC toolchain (native)
			-This toolchain is incredibly powerful and has surpassed
			 the quality of the original omnicross toolchain/.
			 If you came to Grafos looking to build toolchains for
			 your OS this is what you want.

	musl-otter-cross/
		An even smaller toolchain which is musl based for clarity.
			- If you came to Grafos wanting ideas for your own
			  OS, I wrote this toolchain specifically tot require 
			  the smallest number of possible unique steps.

			- ( some oddities remain such as;
				$(XZ) -d -c | $(ARCHIVE) -x
			  These easily can be replaced if they 
			  seem inappropriate. )

	experimental/
		Android support stub.
