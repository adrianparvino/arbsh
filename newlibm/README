Graff's libm


Building:
---------

	make


Installation:
-------------

	make install DESTDIR=/path/to/installation


Description:
------------

	Graff's libm is an extremely minimal derivative of Sun's fdlibm with a
	focus on doing a complete rewrite of libm for the purposes of example
	and education.

	At this time only the following functions are available
	cos
	sin
	floor 
	tan
	rem_pio2 (Remez algorithm)
	It is my hope that they will slowly be rewritten in my own words and 
	understanding

	Libm uses the Remez algorithm with polynomial series expansions to
	obtain its aproximations of transcendental functions.

	Taylor polynomials:

	It is rather unfortunate that in calc II we teach Taylor series at the 
	same time as we teach Taylor polynomials, all the while not doing a 
	very good job of stressing the distinction between an infinite series 
	and a finite sum. In the process we seem to teach students that Taylor 
	series are a much more powerful tool than they are, and that Taylor 
	polynomials are a much less powerful tool than they are.

	The main idea is really the finite Taylor polynomial. The Taylor series 
	is just a limit of these polynomials, as the degree tends to infinity. 
	The Taylor polynomial is an approximation to the function based on its 
	value and a certain number of derivatives at a certain point. The 
	remainder formulae tell us about the error in this approximation. In 
	particular they tell us that higher degree polynomials provide better 
	local approximations to a function.
