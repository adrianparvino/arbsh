Description:
------------

	Graff's libm is an extremely minimal derivative of Sun's fdlibm with a
	focus on doing a complete rewrite of libm for the purposes of example
	and education. At this time only sin, floor and the remez algorithm are
	available. It is my hope that they will slowly be rewritten in my own
	words and understanding.


	Libm uses the Remez algorithm with polynomial series epxansions to
	obtain its aproximations of transcendental functions.
