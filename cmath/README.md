# cmath


	This is not a C math library! The functions are not thoroughly tested and 
	are non-performant in many cases.  
	
	This repository is just a place for me to study trigonometry and calculus 
	and keep track of my ideas.  
	
	Most of the functions here are implemented using their respective taylor 
	series.




	To test these functions, build and run "testmath.c".  
	
	make testmath

	./testmath [arg] [arg]

	
	To use these functions inside a program specify the full path name of
	the function wrapper "math.c":
	
	#include "/path/to/cmath/math.c"
